# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 061 - Deferred Rendering, Multisampling FBO, Post Effects
**Description**:
We start looking at Deferred Rendering. We continue the FBO discussion we had a long while ago and introduce multi sampling to allow the post render to appear smoothly as if we did direct rendering. We Also learn how to access the depth buffer data from our custom frame buffer object then we finish things off by playing with a pixelize post effect on our scene.
