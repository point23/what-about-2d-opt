# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 074 - Voxel Ray Intersection
**Description**:
Today we learn how to use a ray to find all the voxels that a ray intersects within a voxel chunk. We use the popular "Fast Voxel Traversal" algorithm to determine all the voxels that the ray traverses. We then add to it by also getting the intersection points and normal direction for each voxel. When all said and done, we can use this to select any voxel in the chunk to do whatever we'd like.
