# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 019 - Roomscale in WebVR

**Description**:
We're continuing our trip threw WebVR and the next stop is to explore room scale. The idea is pretty simple, you simulate the amount of play space you have setup with the vive and create a virtual stage that determines the range in which you can walk around. Then we do a lil bit of head tracking so we can determine how close we are to the edges of our stage. We fade the stage in based on how close we are to its edges, a poor man's chaperone feature.
