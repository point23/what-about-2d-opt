# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 065 - 3D Knots Challenge
**Description**:
Trying something different today, The other day Daniel of "Coding Train" did a coding challenge about creating 3D knots and have its creation animated. In his video he used P5 to do the 3D heavy work, but since I love procedurally generated meshes, I thought this would be a fun challenge to take what we have of fungi to implement these knots by calculating all the verts, connecting them to triangles then finish by animating it in a different way to display one segment of the knot at a time... clue, we don't update the vertex buffers at all ;)
