# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 032 - Sphere from Lathe/Looped Path
**Description**:
Today we're going to begin the next milestone in which we create a simple scene showing King Kai's Planet from Dragonball Z. To start we need a planet which is really just a sphere. Instead of just building a sphere, we're going to build a lathe/loop function that we can reuse to create more shapes beyond just a sphere. A lathe just repeats a bunch of vertices and for each instance of the copy it rotates the data by some axis.
