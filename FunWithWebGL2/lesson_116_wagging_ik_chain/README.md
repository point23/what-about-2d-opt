# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 116 - Wagging IK Chain
**Description**:
In today's video we're going to continue building up our armature system by creating something called Chains. These are just array of bones that allows us to group animations for our future rigs. We'll explore how to animate our chain with a swaying / wagging sort of animation then playing around with its values and even hack the function a bit to see what else we can do when we generate the animation at runtime. Then we end off generating two poses for our chains then lerping between them as another approach to animating our chains.
