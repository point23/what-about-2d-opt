# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 114 - Pure Transform
**Description**:
In today's video we're going to explore trying to do Transforms without Matrices. We look at a concept from a blog post then take it a step further and push the transform data to our shader and apply it to our vertices without the need of turning our transform (rotation, position, scale) into model matrix. The only tricky bit is applying quaternion rotation but we already covered GLSL code to just that, so its not difficult to complete the task.
