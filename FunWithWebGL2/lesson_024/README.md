# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 024 - Picking with Framebuffers

**Description**:
Today we start to reach into our 3d space and start moving objects around with a mouse. We accomplish "Picking" by creating a custom framebuffer that we render too on the side, which helps use determine if we clicked onto a selectable object. Also included is some changes and bug fixes to our Fungi Graphics Engine.
