# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 007 - Quads

**Description**:
In today's lesson we start filling up our 3d space with new objects to render. We're moving onto using triangles to create a fundamental 3d shape, the quad.  This is the most simplest shape we can create but its also the one shape that is the most versatile in our toolbox. Heres just a few things you can do with a quad: render tons of grass,  display text since each letter is a textured quad, texture quads in particle effects. Beyond that we explore different ways to render multiple objects on screen, eventually settling on batch creation of quads into a single vertice array that allows use to use a single draw call to render hundreds of quads in one go.
