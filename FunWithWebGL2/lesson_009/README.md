# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 009 - The Cube

**Description**:
Today we've reach the point in where we can start building our first 3rd dimensional shape, the cube. First we explore the first question when learning about cubes, How many vertices does it take? We go through the exercise of building a cube with the usual first answer of 8 vertices to illustrate why it doesn't work that way. Then we go on and then build our cube how its actually works in GL with some fun animations thrown in for the hell of it.
