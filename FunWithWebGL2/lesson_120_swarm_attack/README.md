# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 120 - Swarm Attack
**Description**:
Exploring the idea of swarms, which at is core are just particles that follow some sort of direction. So we first put together the basics of our system, the data and how to make the swarm move from target to target. Then we explore the idea of the swarm moving in some shape. Then in the end we let our swarm form itself into a spiral for a rush attack or a tentacle for a whip attack then returning back to its default swarm movement.
