# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 095 - Cylinder Wrapping and Tappering
**Description**:
Time for more procedurally generated mesh fun. Today we explore manipulating a plane by wrapping it around a cylinder. Then we kick it up a notch and change the plane to have a spiral like pattern before doing the cylinder wrapping. Then we explore how to apply tappering. In the end we'll end up with a 3D spiral drill. From there I use previous code for mesh generation to create a platform and the rest of the parts to create the Spiral Core from the anime, Gurren Lagann.
