# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 130 - Spring Vertices
**Description**:
In this video we're going use springs on vertices, but instead modifing a vert array and uploading to
the gpu, we are going to do all the computation on the gpu itself by using Shaders and TransformFeedback.
This will allow us to be as efficent and fast as possible. For fun we're going to build terrain
using noise while using springs to move all our verts to the desired position.
