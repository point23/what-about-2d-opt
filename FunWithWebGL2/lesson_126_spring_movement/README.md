# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 126 - Spring Movement
**Description**:
In this lesson we explore a bit of spring physics. We'll focus on on equations based on 1D movement to keep
things super simple, but like curves, its requires little to no effort to expland it to 2D or 3D. We'll
cover a few different examples of the math I found, also discuss a few different examples of how to apply delta
time to spring movement. We'll end by checking out an example of how to calculate the SpringConstant and Damping
based on a few inputs like start/end positions, how much time to cover the distances and how many bounces you
want the spring to do.

The hopes of this lesson is to get a basic well rounded idea of how to handle springs. This will be the first
lesson of a mini series related to the topic. Future tuturials will hope to cover:
- Spring Rotation
- Spring Bone (Jiggly Bone)
- Spring Bone Chains (Hair, Clothing, etc)
- Soft Body Physics
