# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 078 - Stamina Wheel
**Description**:
After watching a video on how to translate UV coord to polar coord, then use that to draw shapes, it inspired me to try to recreate the stamina wheel from Zelda : Breath of the Wild. We create the shapes, handle some of the animations / states and even shoe horn it into our character controller from the previous video to control how long our cube can run before running out of stamina. Our cube will even need to stand still for a second or two to recover if you exhausted your stamina completely.
