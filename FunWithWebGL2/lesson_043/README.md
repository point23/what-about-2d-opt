# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 043 - Ray to Plane Intersection
**Description**:
Previously we began learning how to turn a mouse click into a raycast. Today we will continue that subjects and learn how to determine where in a 3d plane that ray intersects or collides. This is an important step since most intersection algorithms start with Ray to Plane before determining if there is a collision/intersection of any specific shape.
