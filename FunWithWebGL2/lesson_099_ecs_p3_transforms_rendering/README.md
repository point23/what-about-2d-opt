# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 099 - ECS P3: Transforms and Rendering
**Description**:
With the basic ECS framework put together in the last 2 videos, we start integrating it into fungi to replace our scene graph and rendering functionality. In this video we start putting together real components and systems that will be the basis of how we'll handle objects that we want to draw on the screen.
