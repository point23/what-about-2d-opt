# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 122 - IK Solver Aim
**Description**:
In previous lessons related to inverse kinematics we only worked with simple bones but when applying those examples to meshes
with complete skeletons things don't render very well. In the next set of video we're going to dive into doing IK with actual 
skinned meshes and some of the extra steps needed and things to watch out for. To start with we're going to dive into what I'm
calling the IK Aiming. The idea is to properly aim a limb at the end effector while trying to keep its orientation while applying a twist to control
the direction the elbow or knee points to. This will be the starting point for the rebuilding of our IK solvers from pass videos.
