# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 109 - Inverse Kinematics
**Description**:
In  the next step of kinematics, we explore the inverse concept by using the algorithm known as FABIK. The gist of it is that we have a target that we use to shift all the bones in the right direction to allow our armature  arm reach and touch that target. This is an extension of forwards kinematics, hence the F part of FABIK which stands for Forwards and backwards Inverse Kinematics.
