# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 062 - Depth Testing / Intersection Highlight / Force Field Effect
**Description**:
In the last lesson we finally built up our deferred rendering and the ability to access depth data in post rendering. We continue by using the depth data to test geometry intersections to highlight then base on a threshold. This allows us to create an effect that mimics what you'd expect from a force field wall.
