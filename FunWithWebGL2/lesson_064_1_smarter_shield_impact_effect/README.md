# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 064.1 - Smarter Impact Shield Effect
**Description**:
This is a follow up video. In the original video I used instanced spheres and an extra shader to create the impact animations. This time around I have a better solution which just requires just using unit vectors and the dot product the just the shield shader to perform the same effect. This is the smarter solution to the effect compared to how its done in video 064.
