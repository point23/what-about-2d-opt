# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 081 - Tron Line Shader
**Description**:
Been eyeing this material from Liaret for a long while now. We're now at a point were we can start making materials like this. We go threw the shader on how to create the effect but sadly we will leave it incomplete state because we need a "Bloom Effect" that can only be done in post processing. So in this video we build the shader itself that creates the overall look, then in the next video we explore expanding out ability to do post effects by setting up a new framebuffer to create the bloom effect that will complete the tron material.
