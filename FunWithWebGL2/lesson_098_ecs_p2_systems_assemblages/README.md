# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 098 - ECS P2: Systems and Assemblages
**Description**:
With Components and Entities setup. Now we walk through that a system processes logic for components within entities. We also explore
the idea of Assemblages, which is a class that handles creating entities with predefined components to make things easier to create new items. Then we tie it all together with a global ECS object that manages our Entities and Systems interactions.
