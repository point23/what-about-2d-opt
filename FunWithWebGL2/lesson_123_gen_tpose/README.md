# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 123 - Generate T-Pose
**Description**:
In the previous lesson we learned a new IK Solver i put together called Aim. By taking some of the ideas and removing the parts
related to twist, we can simply align bones aiming at specific direction. We can easily apply this to the arms and legs of a 
model to force the mesh into a T-Pose. Having a t-pose will make IK easer moving forward, so its great to be able to make
meshes into that pose dynamically without the need of 3D Software package.
