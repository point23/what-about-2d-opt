# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 097 - ECS P1: Components and Entities
**Description**:
Starting with this video we are going to start building an implementation of an ECS design pattern. Since its javascript, we are not able to build something that will be optimized to run with CPU Cache but there is other benefits of ECS that can make things easier for us to build an engine that will be more flexible and easier to maintain in the long run. So lets start by putting together Components and Entities and how they will relate with each other.
