# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 129 - Spring Bone Chain
**Description**:
In the previous lesson we learned how to build a jiggle bone. In today's lesson, we're going 
to expand it by applying the concept to an array of bones. This gives us the ability to start 
animating specific things like hair, clothing, tails, whatever use you can think of that is 
skinned with a chain of bones.
