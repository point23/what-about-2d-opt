# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 066 - Basic Voxels Part 1
**Description**:
Starting a new topic for the series. Today we explore all the theory and some code to build a basic 2D voxel chunk. I do some whiteboarding in this video to explain some ideas and concepts with dealing with voxels. Then in part 2 will modify what we have and bring our voxel chunk to render in 3D.
