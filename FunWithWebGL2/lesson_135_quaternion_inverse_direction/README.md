# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 135 - Quaternion Inverse Direction
**Description**:
This is the first video in relation to IK Animation. Before dealing with IK stuff, I want to
go through a few math ideas that I found to be important when trying to animate characters 
with IK. The first one i'm calling "Quaternion Inverse Direction", because I have no better
name for it since I noticed this after a few failed attempts of IK animation. The main idea
is to try to create a universal direction no matter what rotational orientation all your
objects exist in.
