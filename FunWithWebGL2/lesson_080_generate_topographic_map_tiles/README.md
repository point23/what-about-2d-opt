# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 080 - Generate Topographic Map Tiles
**Description**:
Breath of the wild has a very cool map system and I love the topographic look of it. So I tried to create a way that I can turn 3D terrain chunks into 2D topographic map tiles that can be stitched together to build a world map that has a 1:1 relationship with the 3D terrain. This would allow to make markers or way points that is very accurate.
