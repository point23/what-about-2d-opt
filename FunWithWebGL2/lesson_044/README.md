# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 044 - Ray to Triangle Intersection
**Description**:
We continue learning ray intersections by determining if the intersection point is within the range of a triangle that exists in our scene. We explore two different algorithm to achieve this goal, Edge Checking and Barycentric Coordinates. We step through the algorithms and visualize certain bits to try to understand how they work.
