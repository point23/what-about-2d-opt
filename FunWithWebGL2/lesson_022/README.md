# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 022 - Uniform Buffer Object (UBO)

**Description**:
Today we learn to use a new feature in WebGL 2.0, the Uniform buffer object, also known as Uniform Blocks. This allows us to setup global uniform data that 
can be set once and used by multiple shaders. This is a great way to optimize our rendering by using less gpu calls by not setting those uniforms per shader per frame.
