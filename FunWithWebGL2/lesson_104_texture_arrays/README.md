# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 104 - Texture Arrays
**Description**:
Today we explore a feature of WebGL 2.0 called Texture Arrays. Its similar to the idea to texture atlas but without all the manual work of calculating the UV positions. Since this feature is built in, it makes it super easy to use compared to atlases. Once we learn how to created, configure and upload a texture array to the GPU plus how to use in a shader. Then at the end you'll see me apply it to our voxel system to start putting together that portals 2 editor prototype I've been wanting to do.
