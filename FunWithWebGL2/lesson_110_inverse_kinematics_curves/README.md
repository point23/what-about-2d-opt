# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 110 - Inverse Kinematics with Curve Placement
**Description**:
In  the attempt of recreating IK-Rigs, we explore different ways  to go about doing Inverse kinematics beyond just FABIK or just adding to it. We explore how to easily do a two joint chain like Arms and legs just by doing a bit of triangle math to create reach that does not need FABIK to work. Then we try augmenting FABIK by apply curves while trying to reach for an object. I go through using catenary, circular and sine curves which gives us different ways to reach for an object and how to handle chains that are longer then 2 joints.
