# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 127 - Spring Rotation
**Description**:
In this lesson we explore more spring math by instead using rotation instead translation. We will
also explore a different sort of spring called Soft Constraints also known as implicit euler and 
semi-implicit euler which is used by some physics engines like Box2D. 

We also continue to build our baller controller since the last video. We use spring rotation
to control the movement of the plunger gun that is attached to the sphere.
