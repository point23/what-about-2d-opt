# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 108 - Armature Locomotion
**Description**:

Today we finally have our armature take its first steps of movement. We explore the idea of tracking the movement of the feet during its animation cycle and when its within a close range to the floor we apply the foots current velocity to the armature. This mean, every step actually moves our model forward... or backwards. So our movement speed and direction can be driven purely on the animation and proximity to the floor.
