# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 083 - UV Mapped Icosphere / Icosahedron
**Description**:
Building an Icosphere is actually a pretty easy thing to do, but the trickiest part to get working is having it UV mapped procedurally. We explore setting up a new Geometry class with some support classes like Vertex to help us manage the data to produce the base shape of the Icosahedron then we explore how to do subdivision to a triangle that allows us to form it into a Icosphere. Then we continue on with an article that explains how to apply UV mapping and the steps to fix it so maps fairly well without a seam.
