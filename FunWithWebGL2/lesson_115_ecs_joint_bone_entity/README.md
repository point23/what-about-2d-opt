# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 115 - ECS Bone/Joint Entity
**Description**:

Today we're going to rebuild part of our armature system where the bones / joints will become ECS entities. Before, our system was built as a self contained system but that leaves us with limitations. By allowing our bones to exist as entities in the system, we can do entity type things like adding components to it, we can easily attach children to bones like sockets. This sets us up to do future thing like adding physics to our bones. While we're add it, we're going to add 3 axis scaling to our bones, so we can control how our bones scale in  the future.
