# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 091 - Basic Terrain Editor
**Description**:

I want to make 3D tools, not just games. So with this video we build up a very basic terrain editor. Set up all the pieces needed to get such a tool running, like being able to click anywhere on the 3D plane to raise or lower the vertices plus being able to draw on a 2D texture and have the 3D model reflex the changes in the terrain. The goal being that this sample can be a starting point for anyone who wishes to make a terrain editor of their own.
