# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 079 - Adding and Removing Voxels
**Description**:
Going back to voxels again. Last video we got raycasting working within a voxel chunk. So we know every voxel that the ray intercepts. Today we're going to use that data to determine which voxel we want to add or delete in our chunk. In the end we will have the makings of a voxel art tool, or for my purpose, level editor.
