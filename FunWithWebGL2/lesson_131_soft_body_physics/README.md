# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 131 - Soft Body Physics
**Description**:
Today we continue from the last lesson, where we did all our springs computation on the gpu. 
Springs are used to help simulate soft body physics and one component need to help is a bit
of collision. So we're going to deal with a bit of collision detection in our computer shader
and when the collision is released our mesh will spring back to its resting position. We'll explore
floor collision, sphere to sphere and end with using ray intersection to add a big of push to our
test vegeta mesh.
