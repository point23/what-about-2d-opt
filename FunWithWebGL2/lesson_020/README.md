# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 020 - Head Tracking in WebVR

**Description**:
Now we're going to play with head tracking but this time we are going to have a cube setup to simulate where our hmd is in relation to the stage that is configured to simulate your room space. See as I walk around my room and you can visually see on screen where the HMD and what direction its pointing at. Great Effing stuff.
