# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 118 - Piston IK Solver
**Description**:
Today we work on a simpler IK solver, something I call piston, since I can't come up with a better name. This is a more mechanical sort of solver where it involves having bones fold into their parent bone, like some kind of telescopic lens or an antenna. Something useful more more machinery kinematics.
