# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 101 - ECS P5: Advanced Components and Systems
**Description**:
Lets start having some fun by creating more components and systems that we'll need in the future. We recreate our dynamic vertices functionality plus another system to handle individual Behaviours per entity, basicly adding an UPDATE. We do some dynamic loading of the systems so they are optional if we need to use them for any specific page.
