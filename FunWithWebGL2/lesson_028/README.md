# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 028 - 3D Editor for Bezier Splines
**Description**:
For every engine, you will need to develop tools to help yourself or others to easily manage 3d assets. In todays lesson we continue our work with bezier curves by creating splines out of them along with building a foundation on how to build a Editor to manage spline data, this includes dragging around points and applying constraints for curve anchors.
