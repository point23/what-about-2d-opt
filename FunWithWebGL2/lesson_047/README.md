# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 047 - Ray intersects Bounding Box (OBB)
**Description**:
With AABB out of the way, now it's time to learn about OBB, known as Oriented Bounding Boxes. The idea is the same as AABB, where you test each axis as a single dimension to narrow down the point of intersection. The only difference is that OBB takes rotation into account, so we need to take a few extra steps and a few changes in the math to make this doable.
