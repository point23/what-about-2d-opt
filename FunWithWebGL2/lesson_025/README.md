# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 025 - MRT and Post Effects
**Description**:
We continue off from the last lesson about frame buffers and upgrade our code to support and use Multiple Render Targets (MRT). Using MRTs allows us to explore post effects like blur that you can apply after your rendered all the objects in your scene. MRT also opens up the your opportunity to explore things like deferred shading (lighting).
