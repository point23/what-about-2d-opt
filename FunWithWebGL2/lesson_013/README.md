# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 013 - Refactoring Shader and Resources

**Description**:
In today's lesson we're going to start refactoring out existing code to help us down the line in future lessons. The first thing we're changing is how we handle shaders by using our new ShaderBuilder class. Along with that, we're going to build the beginnings of a Resource loading class that will download images and load them up in gl as textures.
