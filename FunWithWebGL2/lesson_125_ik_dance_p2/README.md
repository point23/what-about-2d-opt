# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 125 - Procedural IK Dance P2
**Description**:
Now with much of our IK system built, we're going to explore recreating an example of procedural animated dance. Its
something I found a long while back when I first started to learn about ik. Its a pretty cool experiment done in unity 
that depends on its IK system and various other things that exists in the C# language. So we'll step though building
a simple version purely with javascript and webgl. This is a fun example of building a semi complicated procedural
animation.

In the second part, we're going to focus on moving the spine and the arms.
