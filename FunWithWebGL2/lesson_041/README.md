# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 041 - Meshes and Skeletons from GLTF
**Description**:
We're reaching a point that we can no longer just create mesh data by hand and rather use complex models with animations and what not. So we're going to explore creating a GLTF loader since that format is easier to use and can bring in more data then OBJ files. We step through a triangle example then start loading in more complex meshes that include skeleton data so that we can start manipulating cool looking models by code. We get to see the return of pirate girl that we haven't seen in months, today we finally begin her first few joint controlled movements.
