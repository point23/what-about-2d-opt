# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 075 - Build a Particle System
**Description**:
Would be great to do more effects in the future, but doing things manually is a bit much. So today we explore the idea of building a particle system similar to what you get from game engines line unity. A system with loads of options that allow you to customize the effect without much effort, which make it easier to experiment and play with creating effects. So we touch back with transform feedback, explore handling data differently by using interleaved data buffers then setup a system that can generate all the data, plus the shaders based on the options you've selected. As an added bonus, we try to make these options as modules, or plugins that can be easily added to the system for use instead of hard coding thing little feature.
