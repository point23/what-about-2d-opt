# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 053 - Instanced Particles with TransformFeedback
**Description**:
Second video on building a particle system, we're going to explore how to mix instancing with transform feedback as preparation for dealing with meshes in future videos. After we set everything up, we start to push a few thousand particles on screen and play around with our shader to change the effect on how the particles render.
