# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 057 - Particles with Animated Texture Masks
**Description**:
Being inspired by a tutorial from CFN, we attempt to take the idea into a different direction. We grayscale the texture atlas to use them as mask data to create a "black fire" type of effect. We learn how to use the atlas to create a particle that acts like an animated sprite. Then we play around with math to manipulate the texture mask in various way to explore what looks we can generate. Once a single particle is setup, we make a bunch of them and watch them go.
