# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 051 - Transform Manipulator with Ray Intersection
**Description**:
Bonus video related to ray intersections. This time we take an old example of how to build a manipulator ui control but instead of using picking to tell that you clicked on it, we will use rays and a bit of math to determine which axis OR plane you want to move your object. We build the UI tool further where we can attach a renderable to it and then move it around our scene.
