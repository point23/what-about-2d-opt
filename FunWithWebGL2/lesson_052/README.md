# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 052 - Create Particle Systems with TransformFeedback
**Description**:
Going to start a sub series related to doing special effects in webgl. To create effects we need to first build a particle system that can handle all the data and interpolate between different states. We're going to explore a new feature to WebGL 2.0 called TransfromFeedback that allows us to have our vertex shader calculate  our current state BUT save it so a gpu buffer so as programmers we do not need to have the cpu handle the animations, have it all completely handled in the gpu.
