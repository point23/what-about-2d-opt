# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 085 - Curved Paths
**Description**:
Lets have some fun playing around with NecessaryDisorder's trick in creating curves. We rebuild the idea in the browser in 2D, then we take it into 3D. Then we use that paths as a way to have a single particle travel along it then explode when it reaches the end of it path.
