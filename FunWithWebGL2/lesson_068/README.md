# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 068 - Voxel Wave (Cube Wave Challenge)
**Description**:
After upload the voxel lessons, youtube suggested I check out Coding Train's new video, Cube Wave. After watching it I had to give it a try with the new voxel functionality. As promised, I was going to do tangents back into voxels. With today's lesson I go over the changes / additions to our voxel code to get this animation working. We explore how to turn a Voxel cube into a Voxel sphere, create a new renderable for dynamic updating voxel vertex data to the gpu, we also explore a different oscillating function, The Triangle Wave. Plus best of all, animating voxel data.

Side note, Funny how this is coding train's 86th challenge and this becoming my 68th video. Flippy Floppy.
