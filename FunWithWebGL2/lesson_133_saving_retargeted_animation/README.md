# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 133 - Saving Retargeted Animation
**Description**:
In the last video we explored how to retarget animation from one character onto another.
In this video we're going to continue by saving the data back out into a new GLTF json & bin 
file so we can run the animations on our target meshes without redoing the retargeting. We're
going to step through the process of creating a new animation object from our retargeting, then
step through a custom made GLTF export to save out the animation and its armature. Then finally 
we learn how to generate JSON and Binary files in javascript and start a download process
to save the files onto your desktop without any backend servers, purely client side file
saving.
