# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 089 - Space Scene 
**Description**:
The last two videos we've been building a low poly planet, now lets have some fun with it. We use bezier curves to create a path for a rocket to travel from one point of the planet to another. Once it hits, it marks the spot as a destroyed part of the planet. We add a cloud layer to the planet to make it look nice then we finish it of by throwing in a skymap of space.
