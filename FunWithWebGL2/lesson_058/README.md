# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 058 - Programmically Animate Armature
**Description**:
Special treat, we're back to dealing with armatures (skeletons). Since I couldn't get poses exported from blender, I decided to go a different route. Instead of loading up poses or animations, we're going to write code to manually animate an armature. On top of that, we get to use Bendy, from Valve's the lab as our test subject moving forward with all our armature work. So lets dive in and breath a lil life into bendy.
